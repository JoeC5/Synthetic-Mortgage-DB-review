# Synthetic-Mortgage-DB-review - Work in Progress

As I am learning Python, Data Science, Data Analytics, GIS, and a bit of Machine Learning I wanted to create a data base of "fake" U.S. mortgage information, then analyze said for practice, and build a mortgage default predictor leveraging logistic regression. This repository will hold the following:
 - the created mortgage data base
 - the Python code I used to create this data base (leveraged Claude.AI, ChatGPT, and Copilot to help with some of this)
 - the exploration of the data base using the use of Python, Numpy, Pandas, GIS tools/visuals
 - build a mortgage default predictor via logistic regression (scikit-learn)
